  Grammy winning singer/songwriter Chris Brown releases his 11th solo studio album 11:11 via RCA Records/Chris Brown Entertainment – click here to listen. This latest project is split into two entities – 11am and 11pm – with 11 tracks in each section, keeping with the theme of this being Brown’s 11th solo studio album. A-list features such as Future, Davido and more are on this album as well as the previous singles “Summer Too Hot,” “Nightmares” and “Sensational” that Brown released prior to the album drop. 11:11 signifies yet another top tier era of Chris Brown and what he always does best with his music – delivering hits, upbeat, sultry vibes and undeniably smooth vocals.

All singles released prior to album also came alongside official visuals. Directed by Christian Breslauer, the “Summer Too Hot” video showcases dancers from all of Brown’s past eras in a vibrant, playful way that asserts that love rules all. It is an ode to a passionate summer in Los Angeles where he is continuing to level up and find his groove, while also acknowledging the people who have led him to where he is (click here to watch). The child.-directed “Sensational” visual featuring Davido & Lojay highlights those signature Chris Brown dance moves and specials effects (click here to watch) and the Travis Colbert-directed “Nightmares” video featuring Byron Messia was shot in different communities in Jamaica and was creative direction by Chris Brown himself  (click here to watch).

 

Previously, Brown released his Grammy nominated BREEZY (Deluxe) album in July 2022 (click here to listen) and the alternative BREEZY – It’s Giving Christmas version in November 2022 (click here to listen). The  deluxe version added Anderson .Paak and Davido to the already star-studded list of features from major artists that included H.E.R., Jack Harlow, Bryson Tiller and more. Throughout his career, Brown has continued to break records – even his own – and received a plethora of accolades.

 

Over the past three years alone, he’s garnered nominations and wins from multiple award shows. “Go Crazy” won three Soul Train Awards in 2020 for Song of the Year, Best Collaboration and Best Dance Performance and garnered seven more nominations in 2021. He was also nominated for seven Billboard Music Awards, including Top R&B Artist, Top R&B Album and Top R&B Song (“Go Crazy”), four BET Awards including Video of the Year (“Go Crazy”) and Best Male R&B/Pop Artist, two BET Hip-Hop Awards for Best Hip-Hop Video (“Go Crazy”) and Best Duo or Group, and two MTV Video Music Awards for Best R&B Song (for two songs – “Go Crazy” and “Come Through” with H.E.R.). Chris recently won Favorite Male R&B Artist at the 2022 American Music Awards and Best R&B/Soul Male Artist at the 2022 Soul Train Awards. This year he’s been nominated for 4 BET Awards for Album of the Year, Best Male R&B/Hip-Hop Artist, Best Collaboration (“Call Me Every Day” feat. Wizkid) and Video of the Year (“WE (Warm Embrace)”) and is currently nominated for an MTV VMA nomination (“Best R&B” with Chlöe). Most recently he’s been nominated for two 2023 Billboard Music Awards – “Top R&B Artist” and “Top R&B Male Artist.”

 

Chris Brown currently stands as the R&B singer with the most Hot 100 entries in Billboard history to-date and continues to break records with his globally successful career.
