# TODO
- [x] clean up code
- [x] port audio over to finalized video
- [ ] adjust target image to be autogen'd from grabbing the frame to remove (same dimensions)
- [x] wrap it all under a cli (its a function, whatever)
- [ ] move the saving of the final video to the top scope of the file outside of `main` in `image_replace`
